I like to know what my friends lives are like, and they seem
to like to know what mine is like, so I like to send them emails
about what my life is like.

Motivation
============
I tried mass-producing emails in hopes that I would benefit
from economies of scale, but that felt a bit stressful and complicated and
unnatural. So I'm going to try doing hand-crafted artisinal
emails instead. More specifically, I'm periodically (like
weekly or daily) going to choose a person to email.

Selection method
=================
I want to focus on people that I am losing touch with.
I'm selecting people based on my prior emails with them.
My goal is to select people who I know very well and
haven't talked to in a while.

The present system looks for people whom I've emailed
a lot before but haven't emailed with in a while; it
comes up with a number that is high if I used to email
people a lot and haven't emailed people in a while.
And then it tells me to email the person whose number
is highest.

How to use
==============
To select a person, just run ``make``.

You (I) will probably want to edit the weighting function
quite a bit. The function is just something I made up, not
based on any interesting theory or training data. Edit it
by editing the ``weights`` function in ``weight.R``.
Then run ``weight.R`` and look at the
``data/*/weight{-change,}s.pdf`` files to get a feel for
whether you came up with a decent weighting.

The entry point for the whole thing is the ``Makefile``,
so start there if you want to change anything else.

Things to try
==============

* Get separate fields for messages from me and messages
  to me, and weight people based on that. My guess is
  that people with similar numbers for both of these are
  more of the sort that I want to email.
* Come up with some way of checking that the weighting works.
* Deal with people who have changed email addresses.
